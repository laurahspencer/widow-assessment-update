Data from three fishery-independent surveys were used in this assessment: 1) the SWFSC and
NWFSC/PWCC Midwater Trawl Survey (hereafter, “juvenile survey”); 2) the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)/NWFSC Triennial Shelf Trawl Survey (hereafter, “triennial survey”); and 3) the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (hereafter, “WCGBTS”). These surveys employed different designs and sampling methodologies, were conducted during different years and time periods within years, and included coverage over different areas of the coast. In some instances, the survey frequency, depths, and geographic areas covered were not internally consistent within surveys. A brief description of each survey is provided below. 

Strata were defined by latitude and depth to analyze the catch-rates, length compositions, and age compositions using stratified random sampling theory (Table 6 & Table 7). The latitude and depth breaks were chosen based on the design of the survey as well as by looking at biological patterns in relation to latitude and depth. Indices of abundance for all of the surveys were derived using model based approaches described below.

### \arclong{s-juv}

An update of the coastwide pre-recruit indices of abundance was obtained from Tanya Rogers (SWFSC, pers.comm.). These indices of abundance were estimated using data from three separate midwater trawl surveys for young-of-the-year (YOY) pelagic juvenile rockfish. Identical gear was used by each survey, and combining the data provides the best opportunity to create coastwide indices. Only years that covered waters from 36°N latitude to the U.S./Canada border were used. The indices were constructed using vector-autoregressive spatiotemporal models (Thorson, 2019; Thorson and Barnett, 2017) available within the VAST R package. This method represents an update from the 2015 assessment, which used Delta-GLMM, but both indices provide similar estimates of trend. The index shows a very large number of age-0 fish in 2013 and a moderate value in 2004 (Table 8). Juvenile survey data from 2001-2003 were removed, following the 2015 assessment because only years that covered waters from 36\textdegree N latitude to the U.S./Canada border were used; juvenile survey data from 2010 and 2012 were removed, following the 2019 assessment. 

### \acrlong{s-tri}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 [@weinberg_2001_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from the middle of July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from the middle of July through early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91--457 m during the 1977 survey. Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the U.S. West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55--366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55--500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N. In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years. 

### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55--1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. There were only two vessels used in 2019 and three in 2013, with one of the three that year unable to complete its survey pass due to a government shutdown. No survey occurred in 2020 due to \gls{covid}. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders. Note that the Survey is not permitted to access the \glspl{cca} in Southern California.

Widow Rockfish are not commonly caught in the WCGBTS. Higher catch rates occur north of 40° N latitude and catches are rare south of 36° N latitude (Figure 11). Few large fish are found shallower than 100 m and few small fish are found in the deeper water of the slope. There is no clear trend in length with latitude other than smaller fish tend to occur south of approximately 36° N latitude, and there appears to be some very small fish found near 39° N latitude.

An index was created using spatiotemporal species distribution modeling via the sdmTMB package (citation). This reflects an updated approach compared to the 2015 assessment (non-spatial delta-GLMM) and the 2019 update assessment (VAST delta-lognormal model). The sdmTMB index estimates spatial and spatiotemporal variation in encounter probability and positive catch weight across the survey range using a 200 knot grid. The positive catch weight model includes survey pass ('first' or 'second') to account for missing data, i.e., the incomplete second pass of the 2013 survey. Spatiotemporal estimates of weight are then converted into annual indices using XXX (something from sdmTMB??). Both gamma and lognormal error structures were tested for the positive catch model. Both models converged (positive, definite Hessian matrix) but predicted data from both models showed slightly right-heavy tails compared to null expectations, with the gamma model having stronger divergence.

The index estimate is relatively stable, with a slightly increasing trend in recent years and a moderate peak in 2016. Overall, the lognormal index estimates were more comparable to the 2019 spatiotemporal VAST-based index and seemed less influenced by potential extreme catch events, particularly in 2013 and 2016 [is there a more stats-y reason, e.g., AIC score]; for these reasons, the delta-lognormal sdmTMB-based index was used for the base model in this assessment. The delta-lognormal mean value (2262.824) was slightly lower than the means of the index values used in the 2015 assessment (2701.12) and the 2019 update assessment (3301.765). Comparisons of the different error structures, design-based estimate and the VAST index used in 2019 are in Figure XX.

Widow Rockfish have been caught in trawl and hook-and-line fisheries since the early part of the 20th century. Widow Rockfish are a desirable rockfish and are not likely to be discarded for market reasons. However, smaller Widow Rockfish are found at shallower depths and discarding practices in the early 1900s are uncertain. Few Widow Rockfish have been observed (relative to other gear types) in recreational, commercial pot, and commercial shrimp fisheries, thus only trawl, net, and hook-and-line landings were used in this assessment.

In data from the early 1980s, Widow Rockfish have had their own landing category. California began in 1982, Oregon in 1984, and Washington in 1988. Estimates of historical landings of Widow Rockfish rely upon species-composition sampling data from each period. The uncertainty in species composition is greater in past years, with less systematic and extensive sampling occurring prior to 1980. Consequently, the precision with which landings of Widow Rockfish can be estimated likely decreases for earlier years. A description of the methods used to determine the historical and current landings is provided below.

### Fishery length and age data

Biological data from commercial fisheries that caught Widow Rockfish were extracted from PacFIN (PSMFC) on July 3, 2019, from CALCOM on July 3, 2019 and from the NORPAC database on July 3, 2019. Lengths taken during port sampling in California, Oregon, and Washington were used to calculate length and age compositions. The data were classified into bottom trawl, midwater trawl, hake trawl, net, and hook-and-line fleets

Table 10 shows the number of landings sampled and Table 11 shows the number of lengths taken for each year, gear, and fleet from the three states. Table 12 shows these numbers for the at-sea fleet.

Consistent with the 2015 assessment, length and age samples from PacFIN and CALCOM were expanded up to the total landing then combined into state-specific frequencies (Table 13). Expansion factors were calculated in a way such that large expansions would not occur and based on ideas first presented by Owen Hamel (pers. comm., NWFSC). First the expansion factor (Ek) was the total catch weight (Wk) divided by the sample weight (wk), and raised to 0.9 to account for non-homogeneity within a trip. Then, expansion factors greater than 300 were capped (100 for net fisheries) to reduce the influence of small samples (i.e., a few fish representing a large catch). The predicted total numbers at length or age weighted by landings for each state were added to create a coast-wide length frequency. The effective sample sizes of the state combined length frequencies were determined from the following formula, which has been used in previous Widow Rockfish assessments as well as other west coast groundfish assessments.

| Fishery Samples                                  | Survey Samples                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
|  $\ N_{eff} = N_{sample} + 0.138N_{fish} , \frac{N_{fish}}{N_{sample}} < 44$ | $\ N_{eff} = N_{sample} + 0.0707N_{fish} , \frac{N_{fish}}{N_{sample}} < 55$ |
|  $\ N_{eff} = 7.06N_{sample} , \frac{N_{fish}}{N_{sample}} \geq 44$    | $\ N_{eff} = 4.89N_{sample} , \frac{N_{fish}}{N_{sample}} \geq 55$     |


This is slightly different than the sample size of 2.43 per haul for rockfish that Stewart & Hamel (2014) report. Observed lengths were expanded to the tow from At-Sea Hake Observer Program samples (NORPAC). Tows are typically well sampled, thus expansion factors were not modified from what was calculated. Hake fishery length compositions were created by combining shoreside and at-sea length compositions, weighting by the catch from each sector. The effective sample sizes for hake fishery length and age comps were calculated using the above equations for the shoreside fleet and added to the number of tows sampled from the at-sea fleet.

Expanded length compositions for bottom trawl, midwater trawl, hake fisheries, net, and hook-and-line are shown in Figure 17 to Figure 21. It is quickly apparent that all of these fisheries rarely land fish less than 26 cm. All of the non-hake fleets show a strong cohort coming though in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and then another cohort coming through in the late 1980s. Sample sizes typically dropped off after 2000, except in the hake fishery where nearly every tow is sampled. Age compositions for the five fleets are shown in Figure 22 and Figure 26. Occasional cohorts appear to move through the population, indicating that Widow Rockfish population dynamics may be characterized by episodic recruitment events.

### Biological data

#### Weight-length relationship 
Weight-at-length data, which are the same used in the 2015 assessment, were collected from fisheries sampling and by the Triennial and NWFSC WCGBT Surveys, and were used to estimate a weight-length relationship for Widow Rockfish (Figure 30). Weight-at-length was similar between sources with the fishery samples showing a slightly smaller weight at large sizes when compared to the survey data (Figure 31). WCGOP data were not used because only small fish were sampled, the weight of these small fish were typically less than from other sources (Figure 30), and the curves fitted to only WCGOP data were unable to estimate the slope. There were only 81 observations from the WCGOP data, which is a small amount of data compared to everything available. However, these observations may be useful to understand discards.

The weight-length relationship used in the 2011 assessment was similar for males but predicted slightly heavier females at larger sizes than the 2015 assessment (Figure 31). The following relationships between weight and length for females and males were estimated for the 2015 assessment from all of the data combined and were used in the current assessment:


$$
\text{Females: } \qquad weight = 1.7355 \times 10^{-5} \cdot Length^{2.9617}
$$

$$
\text{Males: } \qquad weight = 1.4824 \times 10^{-5} \cdot Length^{3.0047}
$$

where weight is measured in kilograms and length in cm. These relationships were used in the assessment as fixed relationships.

#### Maturity schedule
Estimates of maturity used in this update were the same as the 2015 assessment. Estimates of maturity at length have been presented by Barss & Echeverria (1987), Echeverria (1987), and Love et al (1990). Barss & Echeverria (1987) supplied data collected from Oregon and California commercial and recreational samples, which allowed us to estimate the proportion mature-at-length and proportion mature-at-age for samples from each state (Figure 32). As noted by Barss & Echeverria (1987), the samples from Oregon matured at older age and larger length. Estimates of maturity-at-length from California reported by Barss & Echeverria (1987) are similar to estimates of length-at-50%-mature from samples collected in California reported by Echeverria (1987) and Love et al (1990), although Barss & Echeverria show the smallest length-at-50%-mature. To maintain some consistency with the 2011 assessment and to avoid any potential growth issues by area, the 2015 assessment used maturity-at-age data from the 2011 assessment, but used the data provided by Barss & Echeverria (1987) to estimate a new maturity curve following a logistic function with the data from California and Oregon equally weighted to avoid California dominating the estimated relationship. This maturity-at-age curve falls between the estimated California and Oregon maturity-at-age curves (Figure 32, right), with the age-at-50%-mature estimated at 5.47 and with a slope of -0.7747 (as specified in SS). This logistic maturity-at-age curve was used in the 2015 and 2019 update assessment except that maturity-at-age for ages 2 and lower were set equal to zero (Table 19).

#### Fecundity

Fecundity in rockfish is often not a linear function of weight, but increases faster at larger weights (Dick 2009). Therefore, this relationship is often accounted for in rockfish assessments by using spawning output (numbers of eggs) to determine current status. Dick (2009) did not find a significant relationship between the number of eggs per gram of body weight and body weight for Widow Rockfish. Therefore, spawning output was assumed to be proportional to weight, which is the same as spawning biomass, and is reported here.

#### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality used in this update differed from the 2015 assessment. Natural mortality (M) is a parameter that is often highly uncertain in fish stocks. Past assessments of Widow Rockfish assumed constant natural mortality of 0.125 yr-1 or 0.15 yr-1. The 2011 assessment estimated M with a prior developed by Owen Hamel (NWFSC, pers. comm.) using methods described in Hamel (2014). This prior was based on a maximum age of 44 and 40 for females and males, respectively, a mean temperature of 8 degrees Celsius (about 150m deep off of Oregon), and a gonadosomatic index of 9.99% and 1.86% for females and males, respectively (Love et al 1990). The sex-specific lognormal priors for M have medians of 0.124 yr-1 and 0.129 yr-1 for females and males, respectively, and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 30.7% for each sex. In 2015, discussions with Owen Hamel (NWFSC) led to the development of a new prior based solely on maximum age to use when estimating M. Using all of the available age data, a maximum age of 54 was determined for both females and males, although it has been rare to observe Widow Rockfish older than about 45 years old (Figure 33). This resulted in a prior with a much smaller median (0.0810 or -2.513284 in log space) and a larger standard deviation in log space (0.523694). For the update assessment, an updated meta-anaysis resulted in a prior with a slightly smaller median than the 2015 assessment (0.10 or -2.30 in log space) and a smaller standard deviation in log space (0.438). Figure 34 shows that these prior distributions are wide and not highly informative.

#### Length-at-age

Estimates of length-at-age used in this update were the same as the 2015 assessment. Two different labs have aged the majority of processed otoliths for Widow Rockfish. The SWFSC has been aging Widow Rockfish otoliths for many years, including all of the fishery data prior to 2011 and otoliths collected from the NWFSC WCGBT survey in 2009 and 2010. The Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) in Newport, Oregon aged 1,100 otoliths from the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 2,026 otoliths provided by ASHOP, and 3,467 otoliths collected by port samplers. All of the commercial fishery samples were collected in the years 2011–2014. In total, there are 105,814 paired age and length observations ranging from 1978 to 2014. Figure 35 shows the lengths and ages for all years and all data as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:


$$
\text{Females: } \qquad  L_\infty = 50.34,\quad k=0.15, \quad t_0 = -2.22
$$

$$
\text{Males: } \qquad  L_\infty = 44.19,\quad k=0.21, \quad t_0 = -1.78
$$

The data from each source (ASHOP, port sampling/BDS, Triennial survey, and NWFSC survey) are shown in Figure 36 with fitted von Bertalanffy lines. All of these sources are quite similar, especially observations from ASHOP and the NWFSC survey. The standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of length-at-age are shown in Figure 37. Modelling the CV as a function of predicted length-at-age appears to be somewhat linear from a value just over 0.1 at small lengths and slightly less than 0.045 at larger lengths. However, variance in length- at-age was estimated separately in stock-synthesis.

#### Sex ratios

Females tend to grow larger than males and it is expected that the proportion of females approaches one at large lengths and is less than 0.5 at intermediate lengths. Figure 38 shows that the proportion of females at length from survey data is approximately 50% until approximately 34 cm, when the proportion of females drops below 50%. At lengths larger than 46 cm, the proportion of females increases rapidly to one, suggesting that few males grow larger than 50 cm.

#### Ageing bias and imprecision

Uncertainty surrounding the ageing-error process for widow rockfish used in the 2015 assessment was incorporated by estimating ageing error by age. No changes were made from the 2015 assessment for the update. Age-composition data used in the model were from break-and-burn and surface reads and were aged by the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) in Newport, Oregon and the SWFSC in Santa Cruz, California. 12 Break-and-burn double reads of 1788 otoliths were performed by both the CAP and the SWFSC lab combined. Additionally, 100 otoliths were read both by surface and break-and-burn methods. An ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using a computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error (Punt et al. 2008), and using release 1.0.0 of the R package nwfscAgeingError (Thorson et al. 2012) for input and output diagnostics, publicly available at: https://github.com/nwfsc- assess/nwfscAgeingError. The maximum aged fish read by the surface reading method was 10 years and the cross otolith reads between the surface and break-and-burn ageing methods showed limited variation. Therefore, a unique ageing error was not created for surface read otoliths. A non-linear standard error was estimated by age where there is more variability in the estimated age of older fish was estimated for each reading lab (Table 20 and Figure 39).
