Assessment model

An age-structured stock assessment model was used to predict the biomass trajectory of Widow Rockfish with an approach of balancing parsimony with complexity. This allowed for the determination of general trends in the biomass over time without introducing extraneous data partitions that explain little additional variation. The assessment followed the same model structure as the 2015 base assessment.

To be completed after review.

## Model Structure and Assumptions

For this update assessment, new versions of the previously used software were used. Stock Synthesis v3.30.13  was used to estimate the parameters in the 2019 model. R4SS, version 1.35.3, along with  R version 3.5.3 were used to investigate and plot the 2019 model fits. For the update, Stock Synthesis v3.30.2 and R4SS, version 1.51.0 , along with R version 4.4.2  were used. Bridging from Stock Synthesis v3.24U to v3.30.13 is illustrated in Figure 41. A summary of the data sources used in the model (details discussed above) is shown in Figure 40. Stock Synthesis has many options when setting up a model and the assessment model for Widow Rockfish was set up in the following manner.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

<!-- Description of new modeling approaches and changes made from the last assessment, with rationale. This should include bridging analyses that highlight the data and model changes that were most influential with respect to changes between the assessment being reviewed and the most recent adopted assessment. 

KLO: The TOR says this is not required for updates. I am doubtful the SSC will be ok with that. -->


### Modeling Platform and Structure

<!-- Assessment program and its version used for the assessment (i.e., date executable program file was compiled), description of model structure, definitions of fleets and areas. Description of how the first year that is included in the model was selected and how the population state at the time is defined (e.g., B0, stable age structure). -->


### Model Parameters

<!-- Model parameters: estimated and fixed parameters, constraints on parameters, selectivity assumptions, natural mortality, treatment of age reading bias and/or imprecision, and other fixed parameters, description of stock-recruitment constraints or components, critical assumptions, and consequences of assumption failures.  -->
